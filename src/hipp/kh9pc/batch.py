    """
    Apply collimation rectification iteratively to all raster images in a directory.

    This function loops over all `.tif` images in the input directory and applies
    the `collimation_rectification()` function to each. The user can choose between
    Thin Plate Spline (TPS) or Affine transformations for geometric correction.
    Quality control (QC) outputs for each image are stored in the specified QC directory.

    Args:
        input_dir (str | Path):
            Directory containing the input raster images to rectify.
        output_dir (str | Path):
            Directory where rectified raster images will be saved.
        qc_dir (str | Path):
            Directory where quality control plots and intermediate data will be stored.
        bg_px_threshold (int, optional):
            Minimum pixel intensity difference used to detect vertical edges. Defaults to 20.
        collimation_line_dist (int, optional):
            Expected distance (in pixels) between the top and bottom collimation lines
            in the rectified image. Defaults to 21770.
        transformation (str, optional):
            Type of geometric transformation to apply.
            - "tps": Thin Plate Spline (non-linear, smooth correction)
            - "affine": Affine (linear correction)
            Defaults to "tps".
        verbose (bool, optional):
            If True, prints progress updates during processing. Defaults to True.
        overwrite (bool, optional):
            If False, skips processing for images that already have a rectified output.
            If True, overwrites existing rectified images. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        None

    Workflow:
        1. Scan the `input_dir` for all `.tif` files.
        2. For each image:
            a. Check if the output file already exists.
            b. If not (or if `overwrite=True`), perform collimation rectification using
               `collimation_rectification()`.
        3. Store rectified images in `output_dir` and QC data in `qc_dir`.

    Notes:
        - This function is designed for batch rectification of multiple raster scenes.
        - Each imageâ€™s intermediate data (collimation lines, grids, QC plots)
          will be organized under its corresponding subdirectories in `qc_dir`.
        - The same transformation type (`transformation`) is applied to all images
          in the batch for consistency.

    Example:
        >>> iter_collimation_rectification(
        ...     input_dir="raw_scenes/",
        ...     output_dir="rectified_scenes/",
        ...     qc_dir="quality_control/",
        ...     bg_px_threshold=25,
        ...     collimation_line_dist=21800,
        ...     transformation="tps",
