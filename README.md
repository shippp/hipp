HIPP (Historical Image Pre-Processing) is a python library to pre-process scanned historical (film based) aerial and satellite images in preparation for Structure from Motion surface reconstruction and photogrammetric analysis.

Examples of images that are currently supported or planned to be supported include:
- aerial images with fiducial (or pseudo fiducial) markers, such as from:
  - the [aerial photo single frame dataset](https://doi.org//10.5066/F7610XKM) of [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) (EE)
  - the North American Glacier Photography (NAGAP) database from https://arcticdata.io/
- declassified US reconnaissance satellite images, in particular:
  - KH-9 Hexagon panoramic camera images, i.e. [Declass 3 dataset](https://doi.org/10.5066/F7WD3Z10) from EE
  - KH-9 Hexagon mapping camera images, i.e. [Declass 2 dataset](https://doi.org/10.5066/F74X5684) from EE (to be included)
  - KH-4/4A/4B Corona images, i.e. [Declass 1 dataset](https://doi.org/10.5066/F78P5XZM) from EE (to be included)

## Features

### Data quey and download 

- Download of imagery is supported through our sister package [usgsxplore](https://github.com/adehecq/usgs_explorer).

### Preprocessing of Aerial Images

- **Detection of fiducial markers**
  - Built-in application to generate fiducial marker templates
  - Detection of fiducial marker coordinates using OpenCV template matching
  - Sub-pixel accuracy for fiducial detection
  - Supports detection of 4 midside and/or 4 corner fiducials
  - Filtering of low-confidence matches
  - Estimates the principal point based on valid fiducials
  - **Quality Control Outputs:**
    - Cropped windows around detected fiducials for visual inspection
    - Distribution plots of principal point deviations and individual fiducial coordinates
    - Matching score distributions
    - RMSE of fiducial coordinates before and after affine transformation

- **Detection of fiducial marker proxies (pseudo-fiducial)** *(feature in development)*

- **Image Restitution**
  - Computes the appropriate geometric transformation between detected and calibrated fiducial positions:
    - 1 point → Translation
    - 2 points → Similarity transformation
    - 3+ points → Affine transformation
  - Crops the image around the estimated principal point to a standard size
  - Applies CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to enhance features in the image
  - Computes the full affine transformation matrix (including crop transformation)

See this [notebook](notebooks/aerial_preprocessing.ipynb) for example.

### Preprocessing of KH-9 Panoramic Camera Satellite Images

- **Image Joining**
  - Joins split images into a single composite image
  - Requires input images named sequentially (e.g. `ImageId_a`, `ImageId_b`, `ImageId_c`, …)
  - A small overlap between image parts is required for proper stitching
  - Uses [`image_mosaic`](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/image_mosaic.html) from the [ASP toolkit](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)

- **Image Cropping**
  - Built-in interactive tool to manually select corners of the region of interest
  - Rotates and crops the image to align the selected top edge horizontally

See this [notebook](notebooks/kh9pc_preprocessing.ipynb) for example.
